2. Open the debug console ([Don't know how?](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Debug_Console))
3. You should see a big number, that's your token! Open discord, and do: (prefix may be different depending on your configuration)
```
b!link your_token
```
Where `your_token` is the token from the debug console.

Tokens always reset when you close your game, so you'll have to do this process again if you want to use this mod! You can also let another person link with your token.

b!execute g soy milk
```
You should get the `soy milk` item when you go back to your game.
